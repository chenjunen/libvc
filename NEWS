libvc 001 (2003-05-12)

* Initial release.  This is the same vCard library that was built
with previous releases of rolo.  However, all occurrences of `vcard_'
have now been shortened to `vc_'.  Plus, the header file is now
`vc.h' instead of `vcard.h'.  The next binary releases of rolo and
mutt_vc_query will be built with libvc.  The next source releases
of rolo and mutt_vc_query will have libvc as a dependency.  The
vc(3) man page is not finished yet.
