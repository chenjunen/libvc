libvc 003 (2003-06-14)

* Properly parses vCard version 2.1 files.  This means Microsoft
vCard files can now be properly parsed as well.

* Searching and comparing type names and parameter names are now
case insensitive.

* The build now produces shared libraries as well as static libraries.

libvc 002 (2003-05-15)

* Parsing of parameters are now performed properly and stuffed into
the `name' and `value' fields of the `vc_param_component' structure.
The `str' field has been removed as a result of this (because `str'
was only a silly hack to begin with).

* Fixed a bug in fprintf_vcard that prevented vcards from being
printed.

* There now exists a libvc.spec file for Red Hat Linux.  Therefore,
RPMs will be created for each release from now on.

libvc 001 (2003-05-12)

* Initial release.  This is the same vCard library that was built
with previous releases of rolo.  However, all occurrences of `vcard_'
have now been shortened to `vc_'.  Plus, the header file is now
`vc.h' instead of `vcard.h'.  The next binary releases of rolo and
mutt_vc_query will be built with libvc.  The next source releases
of rolo and mutt_vc_query will have libvc as a dependency.  The
vc(3) man page is not finished yet.
